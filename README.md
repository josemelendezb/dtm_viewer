Dynamic Topic Modeling Viewer
This notebook aims to visualize the evolution of the top seven topics generated from 939,452 scientific articles corresponding to the period 1990 - 2019. The graph shows how the probabilities for the most relevant words (top 100) generated by the topic change over time.

Hold down the shift or control key to select more than one word at a time

Every time you change the selected topic, the set of words associated with it is loaded

If a word disappears for an interval of time it does not necessarily mean that it was not used, it could be that it was not used enough to appear in the top 100
